We promote development and innovation in education, encourage international cooperation and digital learning methods.

We manage a number of national and international incentive schemes to promote quality in universities, colleges, and vocational schools. We also aim to strengthen the quality and relevance in primary and secondary education and training by means of international programmes and schemes.
